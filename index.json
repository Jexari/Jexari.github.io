Introduction Game development has always been a rather time-consuming and expensive process. In our world, enthusiasm can infect a team only at the initial stage of the project (and even then not always), then financial injections into the project will be needed. Here we are faced with monetization. Monetization is a type of process that a video game publisher can use to generate revenue from a video game product. Its competent study will allow not only to recoup the invested funds, but also to profit from the project.\nThe pattern in the picture above is quite simple, you release a game, then pay for it and get some income that you invest in the company and prepare a new game. This is the cycle without which the work of any project is impossible.\n2. Methods of monetization Here we come to the issue of making money on video games. Mankind has come up with many ways to make money on the development of dopamine in players. One of the first can be considered a fee for arcade machines. Quite a lot of time has passed since then, gaming halls are a thing of the past and almost every home has its own computer or other device that can run games. The methods of monetization have also evolved, here are the main ones:\n In-app purchases\nUsually, when using this type, the in-game store has additional products that the user buys at will.\n Advertising\nThe most obvious form of monetization is in-game advertising. This is a great way to make money, but it\u0026#39;s worth noting that users who pay money expect ad-free access. There are several main types of advertising content in games: banner ads (a static banner in part of the screen), full-screen ads (text-graphic ads that cover the background of the game), video ads, game ads (a mini-game in which you can perform primitive actions).\nWhat to choose? It primarily depends on the type of game. For example, in shooters, it is better to forego full-screen ads and banner ads and choose video ads that will open between game sessions.\n Subscription system\nThe user pays a certain amount once a month / year and gets access to the game for this period. Works well with trial access to the game. During this time, the user will feel the possibilities of the game.\nPros: profit is predictable and stable.\nCons: it is necessary to constantly maintain and update the content, to maintain its uniqueness.\n Pre-order and crowdfunding\nIf developers make games for fun, then you can support them through voluntary donations. As a result, we get a product that has no ads, no micropayments.\n Marketplaces\nTypically, income comes as a percentage of sales of in-game items between users. Works great if the audience of the game is large and the game has a lot of things to exchange.\n Premium games\nPerhaps the oldest type of monetization, but still quite popular. The scheme is simple: the user pays money and receives the product. This type is most often used by large brands, as their name guarantees quality. Sooner or later, a successful paid game will be copied and released for a more affordable price.\nSometimes these games may also combine additional in-game purchases or payment for separate content that is not included in the price of the game itself.\n  3. Types of players If the user can deposit money in the game, then it will be useful for us to get acquainted with the types of such payers. Traditionally, there are 3 types of players according to the size of donations: fry or minnows (pay small amounts), dolphins (pay more) and whales (pay huge amounts). In 2015, there was a research on this topic. It was revealed that half of all donators are fry, 40% are dolphins, and 10% are whales. And here we see that these 10% of whales provide 80% of all income. And that half of the fry at the exit gives 1% of the total profit. From this we can conclude that our task is to use our tools to make fry into dolphins, dolphins into whales, and keep the whales, because in fact it is the whales that generate income from the game.\nDistribution of users by groups\nPercentage of income from each group\n4. Social proof Social proof is one of the triggers in marketing that encourages the player to make purchases based on the opinions of others. One example of this technique can be called reviews about the game. It is more pleasant for the user to see when choosing a game not 4, but 5 stars. Or, for example, a notification about the purchase of in-game content by someone. It is not necessary that users know each other, they can be in the same clan or even just in the general chat of the game.\n5. Choice paralysis Choice paralysis is the inability of a person to choose one offer from many. That is, if there are 25 products in the game store, then it will be more difficult for the user to choose …","date":1677346699,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677346699,"objectID":"430f45398f426a348448c6a2c75c2f11","permalink":"https://jexari.github.io/post/monetization_of_games/","publishdate":"2023-02-25T20:38:19+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/monetization_of_games/","section":"post","summary":"Methods of monetization in video games, as well as some marketing techniques","tags":["GameDev"],"title":"Monetization in games","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Content  1 Task Formulation 2 The solution of the problem     1.

What is a Kaufmann\u0026#39;s automaton and how does it work?       The NK-automaton is a network of N Boolean logical elements. Each logic element has K inputs and one output. The signals at the inputs and outputs of the elements are binary (they take the values 0 or 1). The outputs of some elements go to the inputs of others, these connections are absolutely random, but the number of inputs K of each element is static. The logical elements are also chosen randomly.\n      Automaton are autonomous (there are no external inputs). The number of logical elements included in the automaton is assumed to be large, N1. The automaton functions in discrete time: t = 1,2,3,… The state of the automaton at each moment of time t is determined by the vector X(t) – the totality of the output signals of all logic elements.\n      In the process of functioning, the sequence of states converges to an attractor - a limit cycle. The sequence of states X(t) in this attractor can be considered as a “program” for the functioning of the automaton.\n      The number of attractors M and the typical attractor length L are important characteristics of NK-automaton.\n2.

What it is? A dictionary is a data structure in which information is stored in a key-value format. Here I will explain how to access the information stored in a dictionary and how to edit this information, talk about the main methods of dictionaries and how to use them.\n      Let\u0026#39;s create 2 dictionaries, one stores information about students\u0026#39; grades, the other contains a list of students who eat in the canteen (Fig. 1.1). The dictionary is written in curly brackets. It can either contain initial data (students_marks) or be empty (student_who_eat_in_dining_room).\n      As mentioned earlier, all information in dictionaries is stored in the key-value format. If we need to get the value assigned to a particular key, we can do it directly or through the get() method. If the key we entered is missing, then the get() method will return None, but the call without it will give an error. This is important to consider when creating projects where it is not known for sure whether a key with the same name exists in the dictionary.\n      We can also add new keys and values, as well as change the values already in the dictionary. All the actions described above and their result can be seen in Fig. 1.1-1.2.\nFigure. 1.1. Program listing 1\nFigure. 1.2.

Introduction       An account is a set of data about a user that is necessary to authenticate him and provide access to his personal data and settings. Thus, an account consists of a username and password (or other means of authentication). The password is often encrypted or hashed. An account can store a user\u0026#39;s photo or other image, take into account the age of various statistical characteristics of the user\u0026#39;s behavior in the system.\n      It is not uncommon for several users to work on the same computer. On Linux, it is more convenient to manage users on the command line. In the Microsoft family of operating systems, this feature is also present, as is the GUI (Graphical User Interface).\n      Account management is one of the primary responsibilities of a system administrator. It is very convenient to combine users into groups, edit their access rights depending, for example, on their position in the company. This directly affects the security of the information system.\n2. Account management via lusrmgr.msc       Immediately after installing Windows, we start working with Administrator rights. These rights in the OS allow, for example, to create, modify, delete other accounts, perform any operations to configure the system.\n      The lusrmgr.msc snap-in is used to manage accounts (Fig. 1). We can also open it by entering the name in the \u0026#34;Run\u0026#34; command field, or in the internal system search.\nFigure. 1. lusrmgr.msc window\nIn order to create an account, you need to do the following:\nGo to the \u0026#34;Users\u0026#34; folder (Fig. 2). In the menu bar, select \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;, then \u0026#34;New User\u0026#34;. Be sure to fill in the \u0026#34;User\u0026#34; field, the rest if necessary (Fig. 3). Figure. 2. OS users\nFigure. 3. User creation\n      A user group is a collection of user accounts that have the same rights and security permissions. The user account must be a member of at least one user group.\n      Different users have different needs, the administrator can allocate the necessary permissions and prohibitions. If we have many users, then it is convenient to distribute rights not individually, but by user groups. Windows has several built-in groups: Administrators, Users, Power Users, Backup Operators, Guests, Remote Desktop Users, DHCP Administrators, DHCP Users, and WINS Users. We can also create our own group. For this:\nGo to the \u0026#34;Groups\u0026#34; folder (Fig. 4). In the menu bar, select \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;, then \u0026#34;Create Group\u0026#34;. Be sure to fill in the \u0026#34;Group Name\u0026#34; field, the rest if necessary (Fig. 5.1 - 5.2). Figure. 4. List of all groups\nFigure. 5.1. Create a group\nFigure. 5.2. Adding users to a group\n      You can view which groups a user belongs to in the Users folder by right-clicking on the user, then selecting Properties, Group Memberships. If we go to the \u0026#34;General\u0026#34; tab, we can manage the user\u0026#39;s password, and also, if necessary, disable the account (Fig. 6).\nFigure. 6. Management in the \u0026#34;General\u0026#34; tab\n      The administrator can also set password time limits, for this you need to use the gpedit.msc snap-in. Next, go to \u0026#34;Computer Configuration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Windows Configuration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Security Settings\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Account Policy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Password Policy\u0026#34; (Fig. 7).\nFigure. 7. Changing the password expiration time\n3. Account management via cmd       As mentioned earlier, we can manage accounts through the command line. To begin with, we will write the command whoami and whoami /user (Fig. 8). The first displays information about the current user, the second additionally shows the SID (security identifier). SID is a variable length data structure that identifies a user, group, domain, or computer account. The last 4 digits indicate the object\u0026#39;s relative security identifier (RID). 3 sets of numbers before RID is just the SID.\nFigure. 8. whoami and whoami /user\nFor further account management, we need the net user command. With it, we can:\nadd an account (net user NAME PASSWORD /ADD) (Fig. 9.1); add account password (net user NAME PASSWORD) (Fig. 9.4); rename account (wmic useraccount where name=\u0026#39;NAME\u0026#39; rename ‘NEWNAME’) (Fig. 9.2); view account information (net user NAME) (Fig. 9.3); change account password (net user NAME NEW_PASSWORD); disable account (net user NAME /active:no); delete your account (net user NAME /delete) (Fig. 9.5). Figure. 9.1. Adding an account\nFigure. 9.2. Adding an account\nFigure. 9.3. Adding an account\nFigure. 9.4. Adding a password to an account\nFigure. 9.5. Deleting an account\nTo work with groups, you must use the net localgroup command. For example, with it we can:\nlist all local groups (net localgroup); add local group (net localgroup GROUPNAME /add); add existing user accounts to a group (net localgroup GROUPNAME USERNAME1 USERNAME2 /add /domain); display a list of users in a local group (net localgroup GROUPNAME). 4. Conclusion       Thus, having become familiar with the basics of user management in the Windows operating system, we can draw the following conclusions: …","date":1669574576,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669574576,"objectID":"70515911893484e8f55fdbccdca33c29","permalink":"https://jexari.github.io/post/user_management_windows/","publishdate":"2022-11-27T21:42:56+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/user_management_windows/","section":"post","summary":"Managing local user accounts via lusrmgr.msc and cmd.","tags":["Windows","System administrator"],"title":"User management in Windows","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1653768653,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653768653,"objectID":"6baa10c7f2a74eded91a9b6d9f77d852","permalink":"https://jexari.github.io/project/my-project/","publishdate":"2022-05-28T23:10:53+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-project/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"My Project","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Git"],"content":"Content  1 What is Git and what is it for? 2 Basic commands 3 Dictionary    1.
