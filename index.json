What it is? A dictionary is a data structure in which information is stored in a key-value format. Here I will explain how to access the information stored in a dictionary and how to edit this information, talk about the main methods of dictionaries and how to use them.\n      Let\u0026#39;s create 2 dictionaries, one stores information about students\u0026#39; grades, the other contains a list of students who eat in the canteen (Fig. 1.1). The dictionary is written in curly brackets. It can either contain initial data (students_marks) or be empty (student_who_eat_in_dining_room).\n      As mentioned earlier, all information in dictionaries is stored in the key-value format. If we need to get the value assigned to a particular key, we can do it directly or through the get() method. If the key we entered is missing, then the get() method will return None, but the call without it will give an error. This is important to consider when creating projects where it is not known for sure whether a key with the same name exists in the dictionary.\n      We can also add new keys and values, as well as change the values already in the dictionary. All the actions described above and their result can be seen in Fig. 1.1-1.2.\nFigure. 1.1. Program listing 1\nFigure. 1.2. Program output 1\n      Consider two other methods, namely keys() and values(). The first returns us all the keys in the dictionary, the second returns all the values, such as dict_keys and dict_values respectively. If we need to remove a pair from a dictionary, we can use del or pop (). To display all key-value pairs, you need the items() method.\nFigure. 2.1. Program listing 2\nFigure. 2.2.

General information       Web pages can be created in several ways - from scratch or based on some kind of template. Both of these approaches can be implemented in Microsoft FrontPage. This editor was one of the best of its time, allowing you to edit HTML code, as well as view all changes in direct view mode. This editor did not require knowledge of the basics of HTML.\nMain features of the editor:\ncreate and save web pages save web pages directly to the Web view and administer web pages create complex web page designs use predefined HTML tags use ready-made images from the software package, etc. 2.

Introduction       An account is a set of data about a user that is necessary to authenticate him and provide access to his personal data and settings. Thus, an account consists of a username and password (or other means of authentication). The password is often encrypted or hashed. An account can store a user\u0026#39;s photo or other image, take into account the age of various statistical characteristics of the user\u0026#39;s behavior in the system.\n      It is not uncommon for several users to work on the same computer. On Linux, it is more convenient to manage users on the command line. In the Microsoft family of operating systems, this feature is also present, as is the GUI (Graphical User Interface).\n      Account management is one of the primary responsibilities of a system administrator. It is very convenient to combine users into groups, edit their access rights depending, for example, on their position in the company. This directly affects the security of the information system.\n2. Account management via lusrmgr.msc       Immediately after installing Windows, we start working with Administrator rights. These rights in the OS allow, for example, to create, modify, delete other accounts, perform any operations to configure the system.\n      The lusrmgr.msc snap-in is used to manage accounts (Fig. 1). We can also open it by entering the name in the \u0026#34;Run\u0026#34; command field, or in the internal system search.\nFigure. 1. lusrmgr.msc window\nIn order to create an account, you need to do the following:\nGo to the \u0026#34;Users\u0026#34; folder (Fig. 2). In the menu bar, select \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;, then \u0026#34;New User\u0026#34;. Be sure to fill in the \u0026#34;User\u0026#34; field, the rest if necessary (Fig. 3). Figure. 2. OS users\nFigure. 3. User creation\n      A user group is a collection of user accounts that have the same rights and security permissions. The user account must be a member of at least one user group.\n      Different users have different needs, the administrator can allocate the necessary permissions and prohibitions. If we have many users, then it is convenient to distribute rights not individually, but by user groups. Windows has several built-in groups: Administrators, Users, Power Users, Backup Operators, Guests, Remote Desktop Users, DHCP Administrators, DHCP Users, and WINS Users. We can also create our own group. For this:\nGo to the \u0026#34;Groups\u0026#34; folder (Fig. 4). In the menu bar, select \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;, then \u0026#34;Create Group\u0026#34;. Be sure to fill in the \u0026#34;Group Name\u0026#34; field, the rest if necessary (Fig. 5.1 - 5.2). Figure. 4. List of all groups\nFigure. 5.1. Create a group\nFigure. 5.2. Adding users to a group\n      You can view which groups a user belongs to in the Users folder by right-clicking on the user, then selecting Properties, Group Memberships. If we go to the \u0026#34;General\u0026#34; tab, we can manage the user\u0026#39;s password, and also, if necessary, disable the account (Fig. 6).\nFigure. 6. Management in the \u0026#34;General\u0026#34; tab\n      The administrator can also set password time limits, for this you need to use the gpedit.msc snap-in. Next, go to \u0026#34;Computer Configuration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Windows Configuration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Security Settings\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Account Policy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Password Policy\u0026#34; (Fig. 7).\nFigure. 7. Changing the password expiration time\n3. Account management via cmd       As mentioned earlier, we can manage accounts through the command line. To begin with, we will write the command whoami and whoami /user (Fig. 8). The first displays information about the current user, the second additionally shows the SID (security identifier). SID is a variable length data structure that identifies a user, group, domain, or computer account. The last 4 digits indicate the object\u0026#39;s relative security identifier (RID). 3 sets of numbers before RID is just the SID.\nFigure. 8. whoami and whoami /user\nFor further account management, we need the net user command. With it, we can:\nadd an account (net user NAME PASSWORD /ADD) (Fig. 9.1); add account password (net user NAME PASSWORD) (Fig. 9.4); rename account (wmic useraccount where name=\u0026#39;NAME\u0026#39; rename ‘NEWNAME’) (Fig. 9.2); view account information (net user NAME) (Fig. 9.3); change account password (net user NAME NEW_PASSWORD); disable account (net user NAME /active:no); delete your account (net user NAME /delete) (Fig. 9.5). Figure. 9.1. Adding an account\nFigure. 9.2. Adding an account\nFigure. 9.3. Adding an account\nFigure. 9.4. Adding a password to an account\nFigure. 9.5. Deleting an account\nTo work with groups, you must use the net localgroup command. For example, with it we can:\nlist all local groups (net localgroup); add local group (net localgroup GROUPNAME /add); add existing user accounts to a group (net localgroup GROUPNAME USERNAME1 USERNAME2 /add /domain); display a list of users in a local group (net localgroup GROUPNAME). 4. Conclusion       Thus, having become familiar with the basics of user management in the Windows operating system, we can draw the following conclusions: …","date":1669574576,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669574576,"objectID":"70515911893484e8f55fdbccdca33c29","permalink":"https://jexari.github.io/post/user_management_windows/","publishdate":"2022-11-27T21:42:56+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/user_management_windows/","section":"post","summary":"Managing local user accounts via lusrmgr.msc and cmd.","tags":["Windows","System administrator"],"title":"User management in Windows","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1653768653,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653768653,"objectID":"6baa10c7f2a74eded91a9b6d9f77d852","permalink":"https://jexari.github.io/project/my-project/","publishdate":"2022-05-28T23:10:53+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-project/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"My Project","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Git"],"content":"Content  1 What is Git and what is it for? 2 Basic commands 3 Dictionary    1. What is Git and what is it for?       What is Git for, and what is a version control system anyway? A version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time and allows you to revert to a specific version later. Simply put, in case of a file change, the file and the place of the change will be marked, you can also undo the previously entered file changes, see who last changed something and caused the problem and when, and much more. If you break something or lose files, you can easily fix it.\n      One such system is Git.
